# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

- **`npm start`**: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.
- **`npm test`**: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The build is minified and the filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
- **`npm run eject`**: **Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!** This command removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.
